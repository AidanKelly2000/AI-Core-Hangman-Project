# AI-Core-Hangman-Project

## Milestone 1
- Set up Github to start using it to create repositories for projects

## Milestone 2

- This milestone began by creating a python file "milestone_2.py" which was then added to the remote repo.

- Then a list of fruits was created using pythons built in list function, it was assigned the variable "word_list".

- In order to begin the coding of Hangman, the import "random" was implemented, this is used to randomly select a word from the "word_list" variable.

- After this, the user is asked to input a letter which was assigned the variable "guess", this guess was passed to an if statement which determined whether the guess was   adequate. For a guess to be adequate it had to be a string length of one and alphabetic, if this condition was met, the user was told "Good guess!" which printed to the terminal. Anything else was given the printed statement "Oops! That is not a valid input." alerting the user that they didnt meet the conditions of the input. 

- The final step of milestone 2 was to create this README.md file, in order to log all of the stages of creating this Hangman game.
